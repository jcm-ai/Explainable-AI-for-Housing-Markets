# Explainable-AI-for-Housing-Markets

In this project we'll work on AI Explainability methods which are essential to implementing AI in the regulated industries. As a real estate analyst, explore interpretable AI techniques to reveal why prices vary. Use rule-based models to extract decision rules from housing data, visualizing how income, age, and location influence property values. Turn complex market trends into clear, explainable insights, helping stakeholders make informed decisions with transparent AI-driven analysis instead of black-box predictions.

Imagine we're a real estate analyst examining housing markets across California neighborhoods. Some areas command premium prices, while similar-looking houses sell for much less. We begin to wonder:

- **What makes certain locations more valuable?** 

- **Which combination of factors truly drives housing prices?** 

Traditional machine learning models can predict prices accurately, but they rarely explain **Why** one neighborhood is worth more than another. This is where **Explainable AI (XAI)** becomes invaluable.


In this hands-on project, we'll use IBM's **AI Explainability 360 toolkit** to develop clear explanations for housing prices. Using **GLRMExplainer (Generalized Linear Rule Models) and LinearRuleRegression**, we'll identify specific rules determining property values and visualize how features influence predictions. By leveraging **interpretable rule-based models**, we'll analyze relationships between **income, house age, location, and other characteristics**, making complex market dynamics understandable. This project demonstrates how explainable AI empowers real estate professionals, policymakers, and homebuyers to **make informed decisions and understand market trends with confidence**.
